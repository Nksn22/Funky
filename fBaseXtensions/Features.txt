What is the purpose of this plugin?
	I've spent a lot of time coding with demonbuddy and as a result a lot of code has been created.
	The code that seemed to be redudant in separate plugins was moved into this plugin to make life easier.
	Developers can reference it and build plugins without having to build a core for common functions.
